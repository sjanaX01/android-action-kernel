## The Problem

Browser agents only work on websites. Computer Use requires a desktop.

But the real economy runs on mobile devices, in places where laptops don't fit:

- **Truck drivers** submit invoices from the cab using factoring apps (RTS Pro, OTR Capital)
- **Delivery drivers** scan packages on handheld devices—200+ per route
- **Gig workers** accept orders on phones between rides—losing 20% earnings to slow manual switching
- **Field technicians** log work orders on tablets at job sites
- **Mobile banking** happens on native apps with 2FA, not web browsers

**3 billion Android devices. $40 trillion in GDP from mobile-first workflows. Zero AI agent solutions that actually work on these devices.**

---

## Real Example: Logistics Automation

**Priority partnership area.** Android Use automating an entire logistics workflow:

### Before (Manual - 10+ minutes)
```
1. Driver takes photo of Bill of Lading
2. Opens WhatsApp, sends to back office
3. Back office downloads image
4. Opens banking app, fills invoice form
5. Uploads documents
6. Submits for payment
```

### After (Automated - 30 seconds)
```python
# Driver just texts the photo. Agent does the rest.
run_agent("""
1. Get latest image from WhatsApp
2. Open native scanner app and process it
3. Switch to RTS Pro factoring app
4. Fill invoice form with extracted data
5. Upload PDF and submit for payment
""")
```

**Result:** Driver gets paid same day instead of waiting weeks. Back-office work eliminated. No laptop needed.

---

## Why This Works

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Computer Use (Anthropic)
- Requires desktop/laptop
- Takes screenshots → OCR
- Sends images to vision model
- **$0.15 per action**
- 3-5 second latency
- Doesn't work on phones

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Android Use (This Library)
- Works on handheld devices
- Reads accessibility tree (XML)
- Structured data → LLM
- **$0.01 per action (95% cheaper)**
- <1 second latency
- Native mobile app control

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**The breakthrough:** Android's accessibility API provides structured UI data (buttons, text, coordinates) without expensive vision models.

**Real impact:** 95% cost savings + 5x faster + works where laptops can't.

## The Market: Mobile-First Industries

| Industry | Why They Need This | Market Size | Current State |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Logistics** | Drivers use factoring apps (RTS Pro, OTR Capital) in truck cabs | **$10.5T** | Manual, no laptop access |
| **Gig Economy** | Uber/Lyft/DoorDash drivers optimize between apps on phones | **$455B** | Tap manually, lose 20% earnings |
| **Last-Mile Delivery** | Amazon Flex, UPS drivers scan packages on handhelds | **$500B+** | Proprietary apps, no APIs |
| **Field Services** | Techs log work orders on tablets on-site | **$200B+** | Mobile-only workflows |
| **Mobile Banking** | Treasury ops, reconciliation on native banking apps | **$28T** | 2FA + biometric locks |

**Total: $40+ trillion in GDP from mobile-first workflows**

Browser agents can't reach these. Desktop agents don't fit. **Android Use is the only solution.**

## Quick Start (60 Seconds)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Android device or emulator (USB debugging enabled)
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge)
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/actionstatelabs/android-action-kernel.git
cd android-action-kernel

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Setup ADB
brew install android-platform-tools  # macOS
# sudo apt-get install adb           # Linux

# 4. Connect device & verify
adb devices

# 5. Set API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# 6. Run your first agent
python kernel.py
```

### Try It: Logistics Example

```python
from kernel import run_agent

# Automate the workflow from the viral demo
run_agent("""
Open WhatsApp, get the latest image, 
then open the invoice app and fill out the form
""")
```

**Other examples:**
- `"Accept the next DoorDash delivery and navigate to restaurant"`
- `"Scan all packages and mark them delivered in the driver app"`
- `"Check Chase mobile for today's transactions"`

---

## Use Cases Beyond Logistics

### Gig Economy Multi-Apping
**Problem:** Drivers lose 20%+ earnings manually switching between DoorDash, Uber Eats, Instacart.

```python
run_agent("Monitor all delivery apps, accept the highest paying order")
```
**Impact:** Instant acceptance of best orders. Drivers report 20-30% earnings increase by optimizing across platforms.

---

### Package Scanning Automation
**Problem:** Drivers manually scan 200+ packages/day in proprietary apps.

```python
run_agent("Scan all packages in photo and mark as loaded in Amazon Flex")
```
**Impact:** Scan 200+ packages in seconds vs. 20+ minutes manually. Eliminates data entry errors.

---

### Mobile Banking Operations
**Problem:** Treasury teams reconcile transactions across multiple mobile banking apps.

```python
run_agent("Log into Chase mobile and export today's wire transfers")
```
**Impact:** Automate daily reconciliation. Process 1000+ transactions in minutes vs. hours of manual work.

---

### Healthcare Mobile Workflows
**Problem:** Staff extract patient data from HIPAA-locked mobile portals.

```python
run_agent("Open Epic MyChart and download lab results for patient 12345")
```
**Impact:** Extract patient data from HIPAA-locked portals. Automate appointment booking and records management.

---

### Mobile App QA Testing
**Problem:** Manual testing of Android apps is slow and expensive.

```python
run_agent("Create account, complete onboarding, make test purchase")
```
**Impact:** 10x faster than manual QA. Full E2E regression tests in CI/CD pipeline.

### Why Accessibility Tree > Screenshots

| Approach | Cost | Speed | Accuracy | Works on Device |
|----------|------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Screenshots (Computer Use)** | $0.15/action | 3-5s | 70-80% | Desktop only |
| **Accessibility Tree (Android Use)** | $0.01/action | <1s | 99%+ | Handheld devices |

**Technical advantage:** Accessibility tree provides structured data (text, coordinates, hierarchy) without image encoding/OCR.

## About the Creator

**Built by [Ethan Lim](https://x.com/ethanjlim)** - AI engineer

### The Origin Story

I spent a week riding along with truck drivers for a logistics automation project. Sitting in the cab, I watched one driver spend 10 minutes after every delivery manually typing data from a Bill of Lading photo into the RTS Pro factoring app on his phone.

> *"I do this 15 times a day. Can't use a laptop—there's no room in the cab, no internet half the time, and I'm already holding the phone to take the photo anyway. This app doesn't have an API. It's just me and this phone."*

That's when it clicked: **The world has AI agents for web browsers and desktop computers, but 3 billion people work on mobile devices that existing agents can't touch.**

I looked at existing solutions:
- **Browser Use:** Only works on websites—most logistics apps are native mobile
- **Computer Use:** $0.15 per action using vision models, requires a laptop, doesn't work on phones

Neither solved the truck cab problem. So I built Android Use using Android's accessibility API instead of expensive vision processing.

**The technical bet:**
- Android's accessibility tree provides structured UI data (text, buttons, coordinates) without OCR
- 95% cheaper than Computer Use ($0.01 vs $0.15 per action)
- 5x faster (<1 second vs 3-5 seconds)
- Works on actual handheld devices in trucks, warehouses, delivery routes

Posted the demo showing a full logistics workflow. **5 million views. 150+ inbound messages from companies. 550+ GitHub stars.** The market validated the need immediately and continues to grow.

### What's Next

Based on inbound demand, the path forward is clear:

1. **Open-source core** (this repo) - Keep the foundation free to drive adoption
2. **Pre-built agents** - Deploy-ready integrations for RTS Pro, OTR Capital, major delivery platforms
3. **Managed Cloud API** - Hosted solution for companies that need to scale immediately (waitlist open)
4. **Enterprise platform** - SOC2, audit logs, fleet management, dedicated support

**Business model:** Freemium. Open-source core is free forever. Revenue from managed hosting ($0.02-0.05/action) and enterprise features ($5-10k/month for 100+ seat deployments). Target customers: logistics companies (50+ drivers), delivery platforms (1000+ workers), field service orgs.

**Defensibility:** Network effects from app-specific agent templates. First-mover advantage in mobile-first verticals. Direct partnerships with factoring companies and gig platforms create distribution moats.

**Vision:** Make AI agents work where 3 billion people actually work—on mobile devices.
