## 🚛 The Problem: You Can't Fit a Laptop in a Truck Cab

**Browser agents** only work on websites. **Computer Use** requires a desktop.

But **real work happens on mobile devices** in places where laptops don't fit:

- 🚛 **Truck drivers** submit invoices from the cab using factoring apps
- 📦 **Delivery drivers** scan packages on handheld devices
- 🚗 **Gig workers** accept orders on phones between rides
- 🏗️ **Field technicians** log work orders on tablets
- 🏦 **Mobile banking** happens on phones, not web browsers

**3 billion Android devices. Zero AI agent access. Until now.**

---

## 🎬 Real Example: Instant Logistics Payday

Watch Android Use automate an entire logistics workflow:

### Before (Manual - 10+ minutes)
```
1. Driver takes photo of Bill of Lading
2. Opens WhatsApp, sends to back office
3. Back office downloads image
4. Opens banking app, fills invoice form
5. Uploads documents
6. Submits for payment
```

### After (Automated - 30 seconds)
```python
# Driver just texts the photo. Agent does the rest.
run_agent("""
1. Get latest image from WhatsApp
2. Open native scanner app and process it
3. Switch to RTS Pro factoring app
4. Fill invoice form with extracted data
5. Upload PDF and submit for payment
""")
```

**✅ Result:** Driver gets paid faster. No back-office work. No laptop needed.

---

## 💡 Why This Works (The Secret Sauce)

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🚫 Computer Use (Anthropic)
- Requires desktop/laptop
- Takes screenshots → OCR
- Sends images to vision model
- **$0.15 per action**
- 3-5 second latency
- Doesn't work on phones

</td>
<td width="50%">

### ✅ Android Use (This Library)
- Works on handheld devices
- Reads accessibility tree (XML)
- Structured data → LLM
- **$0.01 per action (95% cheaper)**
- <1 second latency
- Native mobile app control

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**The breakthrough:** Android's accessibility API provides structured UI data (buttons, text, coordinates) without expensive vision models.

**Real impact:** 95% cost savings + 5x faster + works where laptops can't.

## 📊 The Market: Mobile-First Industries

| Industry | Why They Need This | Market Size | Current State |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **🚛 Logistics** | Drivers use factoring apps (RTS Pro, OTR Capital) in truck cabs | **$10.5T** | Manual, no laptop access |
| **🚗 Gig Economy** | Uber/Lyft/DoorDash drivers optimize between apps on phones | **$455B** | Tap manually, lose 20% earnings |
| **📦 Last-Mile** | Amazon Flex, UPS drivers scan packages on handhelds | **$500B+** | Proprietary apps, no APIs |
| **🏗️ Field Services** | Techs log work orders on tablets on-site | **$200B+** | Mobile-only workflows |
| **🏦 Mobile Banking** | Treasury ops, reconciliation on native banking apps | **$28T** | 2FA + biometric locks |

**Total: $40+ trillion in GDP from mobile-first workflows**

Browser agents can't reach these. Desktop agents don't fit. **Android Use is the only solution.**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (60 Seconds)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Android device or emulator (USB debugging enabled)
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge)
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/actionstatelabs/android-action-kernel.git
cd android-action-kernel

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Setup ADB
brew install android-platform-tools  # macOS
# sudo apt-get install adb           # Linux

# 4. Connect device & verify
adb devices

# 5. Set API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# 6. Run your first agent
python kernel.py
```

### Try It: Logistics Example

```python
from kernel import run_agent

# Automate the workflow from the viral demo
run_agent("""
Open WhatsApp, get the latest image, 
then open the invoice app and fill out the form
""")
```

**Other examples:**
- `"Accept the next DoorDash delivery and navigate to restaurant"`
- `"Scan all packages and mark them delivered in the driver app"`
- `"Check Chase mobile for today's transactions"`

---

## 💼 Use Cases Beyond Logistics

### 🚗 Gig Economy Multi-Apping
**Problem:** Drivers lose 20%+ earnings manually switching between DoorDash, Uber Eats, Instacart.

```python
run_agent("Monitor all delivery apps, accept the highest paying order")
```
**Impact:** Instant acceptance, maximize earnings, reduce downtime.

---

### 📦 Package Scanning Automation
**Problem:** Drivers manually scan 200+ packages/day in proprietary apps.

```python
run_agent("Scan all packages in photo and mark as loaded in Amazon Flex")
```
**Impact:** Bulk scanning, eliminate manual entry, speed up loading.

---

### 🏦 Mobile Banking Operations
**Problem:** Treasury teams reconcile transactions across multiple mobile banking apps.

```python
run_agent("Log into Chase mobile and export today's wire transfers")
```
**Impact:** Automate reconciliation, fraud detection, compliance.

---

### 🏥 Healthcare Mobile Workflows
**Problem:** Staff extract patient data from HIPAA-locked mobile portals.

```python
run_agent("Open Epic MyChart and download lab results for patient 12345")
```
**Impact:** Data extraction, appointment booking, records management.

---

### 🧪 Mobile App QA Testing
**Problem:** Manual testing of Android apps is slow and expensive.

```python
run_agent("Create account, complete onboarding, make test purchase")
```
**Impact:** Automated E2E testing, regression tests, CI/CD integration.

### Why Accessibility Tree > Screenshots

| Approach | Cost | Speed | Accuracy | Works on Device |
|----------|------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Screenshots (Computer Use)** | $0.15/action | 3-5s | 70-80% | ❌ Desktop only |
| **Accessibility Tree (Android Use)** | $0.01/action | <1s | 99%+ | ✅ Handheld devices |

**Technical advantage:** Accessibility tree provides structured data (text, coordinates, hierarchy) without image encoding/OCR.

├── get_screen_state()     # Dump & parse accessibility tree
│   └── sanitizer.py       # XML → JSON (54 lines)

# Tap coordinates
{"action": "tap", "coordinates": [540, 1200]}

# Type text
{"action": "type", "text": "Invoice #12345"}

# Navigate
{"action": "home"}  # Home screen
{"action": "back"}  # Previous screen

# Wait/Complete
{"action": "wait"}  # Wait for loading
{"action": "done"}  # Goal achieved
```

### Get Screen State

```python
from kernel import get_screen_state

screen_json = get_screen_state()
# Returns: [{"text": "Submit", "center": [540, 1200], ...}]
```

## 🧑‍💻 About the Creator

**Built by [Ethan Lim](https://x.com/ethanjlim)** - AI engineer, YC W26 applicant

### The Origin Story

I was interviewing truck drivers for a logistics automation project. One driver showed me his phone and said:

> *"I have to manually type invoice data from this Bill of Lading photo into the RTS Pro app. Takes 10 minutes every delivery. I can't use a laptop because it doesn't fit in the cab."*

That's when it clicked: **AI agents exist for web and desktop, but the real economy runs on handheld devices.**

I looked at existing solutions:
- **Browser Use:** Only works on websites ❌
- **Computer Use:** Requires a laptop ($0.15/action, vision model) ❌

Neither solved the truck cab problem. So I built Android Use in 48 hours using Android's accessibility API.

**The result:**
- 95% cheaper (accessibility tree vs vision)
- 5x faster (<1s latency)
- Works on handheld devices ✅

I posted the demo showing a logistics workflow. **4 million views.** The market validated the need is real.

### What's Next

This started as a library for developers. But based on demand, we're building:

1. **Open-source core** (this repo) - Foundation for everyone
2. **App-specific templates** - RTS Pro, factoring apps, gig platforms
3. **Cloud API** - Hosted solution for non-technical users
4. **Enterprise platform** - SOC2, SLAs, fleet management

**Vision:** Make AI agents accessible to the 3 billion people who work on mobile devices.
